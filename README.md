# Can's personal setup for nvimr

## Why?

I dislike vscode, and like living in terminal.

## TODO

- Add refactor.
- Check and remove every plugin from kickstart, and rewrite it in custom file. Add documentation below for future ref. 
- Make this repo a pointer to .dotfiles(Will be done when nixos or debian is done)
- Add a good way to automatically open a terminal on root directory of project.
- Add undotree



## Docs

In progress
